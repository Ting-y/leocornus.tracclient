As BuddyPress_ is often used with WordPress_ for social functionality,
it will be a usable feature to add all Trac_ activities to BuddyPress_
activity stream.
So the whole community could review how the tickets are going.

Any updates on Trac_ will have a corresponding activity record on
BuddyPress_ activity stream.
Any user (including anonymous users) could see the updates through
the BuddyPress activity stream.

- **wptc_create_ticket**
  We will using the id, author and summary,
- **wptc_update_ticket**

  [USER] update ticket #[TICKET_ID]

accept
  [USER] accpet ticket #[TICKET_ID]

reassign

activity hook.

QUESTIONS
---------

How to add better summary for the BuddyPress activity stream?
  The `function bp_activity_add`_ have a set of fields to 
  customize the summary of a BuddyPress activity.

How to decide the URL to a ticket?
  Currently, we are using WikiRenderer_ lib to parse the Trac_
  wiki text to HTML, which will parse the ticket id with format
  **#[1-9]+** to HREF link in format 
  **http://BASE.URL/?id=TICKET_ID**
  The **BASE.URL** is configured in WikiRenderer_ 
  rule **trac_to_xhtml**.
  The utility function **wptc_widget_parse_content** will parse 
  the Trac_ wiki text to HTML.
